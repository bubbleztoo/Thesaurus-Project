This is the source (and some compiled code) for a class assignment I did back in 2018. The code is C++ and the final version assumes the OS is windows.

Again, it's C++ and assumes a windows operating system, though the included older versions (the .zips) might not. I know 1.0 does not.

The command line arguments are an int (how big to make the hashtables, literally hashtablesize) and the synonyms1.txt (the dictionary for it to pull from)
so the call I do to run is:
finalvinal.exe 46 synonyms1.txt
